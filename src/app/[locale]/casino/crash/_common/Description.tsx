                        The term 'limbo' often triggers one of two associations. Some may connect it to a state of uncertainty, like being stood up on a date and feeling as though they're left in limbo. Others might instantly picture the entertaining party game that involves forming a line behind a horizontal stick and each participant attempting to pass underneath without touching it or the ground.
                        <br />
                        In this particular case, Limbo refers to a popular online casino game. It maintains a nod to the traditional Limbo game, as its core mechanic is betting lower than a figure displayed on the screen, essentially "staying under the line."
                        <br />BC.GAME offers one of the finest versions of Limbo in the online casino world. Upon launching the game, a constantly rising rocket presents itself. This rocket can burst at any moment, raining down a variety of treasures and significant rewards. Only those players who accurately predict the explosion time get the chance to snatch these prizes.
                        <br />The game's rules are straightforward. Essentially, you are gambling based on a number that appears on your screen. The objective is to ensure that the number you've chosen is lower than the upcoming number.

                        The outcomes of this game are completely random and highly volatile, eliminating any possibility of forecasting the results. It's akin to guessing the color of the next car that drives by your home or trying to predict where a roulette ball will land. While it's true that no effective strategies can be employed in such a game, that doesn't mean you should rely solely on gut feelings.

                        Your task is to place a bet with your preferred cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin. Following this, you need to select your desired payout. The target payout you choose should be equal to or lower than the amount displayed on your screen to ensure a win. However, your winnings rely heavily on luck and probability.
                        <br />
                        The game, designed with simplicity in mind, includes only a few features. One of these is the turbo bet, which significantly accelerates the gameplay. If you prefer, you can use Hotkeys instead of a mouse for efficiency in adjusting the bet or payout amounts and quickly placing a bet using previously assigned keys.
                        <br />
                        Limbo also includes an auto-mode feature, ideal for those who prefer to watch the gameplay unfold passively. The auto bet option can be used with stop limits or to boost the tally of wins or losses. These limits can be applied either together or separately, depending on the strategy you want to employ.
